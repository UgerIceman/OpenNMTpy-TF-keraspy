Original code by @princetyagitech ---> https://github.com/princetyagitech/Computer_Vision/blob/master/Image_Captioning.ipynb

Original code does not support a validation dataset, hence the code has been adjusted so it can leverage one

This code was used for Master thesis and leveraged the Amazon Review Dataset (2018), the full dataset can be found here: https://jovian.ai/forum/t/amazon-review-data-2018/249
