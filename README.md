InceptionV3: Original code by @princetyagitech ---> https://github.com/princetyagitech/Computer_Vision/blob/master/Image_Captioning.ipynb




Original code does not support a validation dataset, hence the code has been adjusted so it can leverage one

The codes were used for a Master thesis, and leveraged the Amazon Review Dataset (2018), the full dataset can be found here: https://jovian.ai/forum/t/amazon-review-data-2018/249
